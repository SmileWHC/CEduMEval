Peng, 36, an associate senior editor of a poetry magazine, is one of the most familiar faces of the show. He can recite around 1,000 poems. With a master's degree in literature, Peng has always been the hot favorite to win the prize, but, surprisingly, he lost two finals in a row—the second season he lost to a 16-year-old high school student, Wu Yishu, and in the third season he was beaten by deliveryman Lei Haiwei. He cried after losing the season three final, “I realized that if I compete and fail again, at least I've tried. But if I don't sign up, that means I'm more of a failure because I'm afraid of trying. Therefore, when season five came around, I decided to give it another go,” Peng recalls. The season five final came down to Peng and 11-year-old Han Yaxuan—again he was facing a much younger rival. This time, though, there was to be no mistake and victory was finally his. In his victory speech, Peng said, “I want to tell people who have a similar experience that, even though you go through all kinds of misfortune or difficulties, as long as you are brave enough to look up, there will always be a light in the sky to guide you out of the darkness. Centuries later, all of our shadows may vanish, but the beauty of poems will last.” (1) 题目内容: How many seasons of the Chinese Poetry Conference did Peng Min take part in? 选项: A. 五季 B. 四季 C. 三季 D. 两季 (2) 题目内容: Who won the second season of the Chinese Poetry Conference? 选项: A. 雷海为 B. 彭敏 C. 吴易书 D. 韩亚轩 (3) 题目内容: What made Peng Min successful? 选项: A. 失败 B. 勇气 C. 困难 D. 不幸 (4) 题目内容: What is the meaning of the underlined word \"vanish\"? 选项: A. 存在 B. 出现 C. 停止 D. 消失 (5) 题目内容: What is the best title of the passage? 选项: A. 不劳无获 B. 活到老学到老 C. 失败是成功之母 D. 好的开始是成功的一半", "ques_answer": ["C", "C", "B", "D", "C"], "ques_analyze": "这篇文章描述了彭敏在参加《中国诗词大会》中的经历。他在第二季和第三季分别输给了一名高中生和一名外卖员，但并未放弃，最终在第五季夺冠。1. 从文中信息可知，彭敏总共参加了三次比赛。2. 第二季的冠军是16岁的高中生吴易书。3. 彭敏成功的关键在于他的勇气，他多次失败却未放弃。4. 根据上下文和语义，可以推测出'消失'的含义为'消失'。5. 文章的主要主题是通过努力和勇气克服困难，关联到'失败是成功之母'。", "ques_knowledges": ["其他领域名人", "叙述经历", "记叙文", "细节理解", "主旨大意", "推理判断", "词句猜测"]}

{"subject": "初中英语", "ques_type": "阅读单选", "ques_difficulty": "容易", "ques_content": "题目内容: The fact that dogs and cats dislike each other is well-known. Now, the results of this new study may cause a similar feeling among pet owners. This is because the study shows that cat owners are usually smarter than dog owners! Dr. Denise Guastello conducted a survey of 600 university students. He asked these young people to choose whether they were dog lovers or cat lovers. The survey also included questions that helped the doctor understand their personalities. After analysis, the doctor concluded that cat lovers are smarter than dog lovers. Denise says the results are clear because people who prefer dogs usually enjoy outdoor activities with their pets and getting along with like-minded people. However, those who prefer cats have more introverted personalities and would rather spend time reading or engaging in other 'intellectual' activities. She believes this might be why they chose cats in the first place. For those who don't believe the survey, here is some sad news - this is not the first time researchers have reached this conclusion. A 2010 study by the UK's Bristol University also showed that 'cat' people were more educated than 'dog' people. However, not all is lost for dog owners. While they may not be as smart, their pets certainly are. A 2009 study showed that when food was placed in front of two lines, dogs were better at finding the food than cats. (1) 题目内容: 谁参加了Denise Guastello的调查？选项: A. 狗 B. 猫 C. 大学生 D. 老师 (2) 题目内容: 划线词“introverted”在中文中的意思是__。选项: A. 勇敢的 B. 内向的 C. 懦弱的 D. 活泼的 (3) 题目内容: 根据第四段，“猫”人比“狗”人更__。选项: A. 受教育 B. 努力工作 C. 安静 D. 外向 (4) 题目内容: 2009年的研究中狗是如何表现出聪明的？选项: A. 跑得比猫快 B. 学得比猫快 C. 抓老鼠 D. 找到线上食物 (5) 题目内容: 这篇文章主要讲什么？选项: A. 狗不喜欢猫 B. 养猫的人比养狗的人更聪明 C. 狗和猫可以和睦相处 D. 养狗的人比养猫的人更聪明", "ques_answer": ["C", "B", "A", "D", "B"], "ques_analyze": "(1) 本题询问的是Denise Guastello的调查中参与的对象。在文章的第二段提到了'600名大学生'，即Denise Guastello对600名大学生进行了调查。因此，参与调查的是大学生，选项C正确。 (2) 本题需要根据上下文猜测划线单词“introverted”的中文含义。根据第三段中的线索，这些人更喜欢在家中进行阅读或者其他智力活动。由此可以推断，他们的性格比较内向，故选项B正确。 (3) 本题要求根据第四段得知'猫'人和'狗'人的不同。文章提到了2010年一项研究发现'猫'的人受教育程度比'狗'的人高。因此，根据这段内容，可以判断选项A正确。 (4) 本题询问的是2009年研究中狗如何展示其智能。文章中提到，狗和猫面前有两条线，只有一条线旁边放有食物。狗能够成功获得食物。由此说明狗在这项实验中表现出了其智能，选项D正确。 (5) 本题询问的是本文主要内容。文章通过调查和前人实验，分析了养猫人和养狗人的性格与教育程度，明确指出养猫的人通常比养狗的人更聪明。因此，这是文章的中心思想，答案B正确。", "ques_knowledges": ["科普知识", "记叙文", "细节理解", "主旨大意", "词句猜测"]}

According to the China Manned Space Agency, Tiangong I re-entered the Earth's atmosphere and some of its debris fell into the South Pacific Ocean. There are many spacecraft that are still in orbit above the Earth. After finishing their missions, they will all re-enter the Earth's atmosphere like Tiangong I. There are two types of re-entries: controlled re-entry and uncontrolled re-entry. Some satellites and manned spacecraft come back to the Earth in a controlled re-entry. Experts calculate the path of the falling spacecraft and its speed. They can guide the spacecraft to fall in a chosen area. Some spacecraft may have problems while in space after a certain amount of time. These spacecraft come back in an uncontrolled re-entry. It is hard to tell when and where these spacecraft will fall until the last few hours. The US space station Skylab came back partially uncontrolled in 1979. Parts of the station fell in western Australia, but no one was hurt. During re-entry, most of the spacecraft will burn up while passing through the Earth's atmosphere.

For example, when you meet someone for the first time, you must address them as Mr or Mrs. When you get to know each other better or when they ask you to, you can use their first names. One day, we visited some friends and had afternoon tea together. Afternoon tea is not just a drink but a light meal at around 4 pm. We ate sandwiches and a large fruit cake. In England, you usually drink tea with milk. So I tried drinking tea with milk too. Fish and chips is traditional food in England. You can buy it and eat it in special fish and chip shops on the high street, or you can take it away and eat it with your fingers! It is delicious! At the bus stop, you must not push your way onto the bus. You need to stand in line and wait your turn. Sometimes people are slow to get on the bus. Once I noticed a gentleman touch a young man on the shoulder, smile politely and say, \"Excuse me! Are you waiting for this bus?\" He was really polite.

But now, Chinese math textbooks are going to the UK. Yi Ke Yi Lian, or One Lesson. One Exercise, is a series of popular textbooks for primary and junior high schools in Shanghai. For about 20 years, this series has helped students to practice what they have learned in class. According to China Daily, this summer, the math textbook series will be put to use in the UK. The British version has 11 volumes, as there are 11 grades from primary school to high school in the UK. The publisher will cut out part of the content in the Chinese version to go with the curriculum setting there. They will also change some terms and background knowledge. But the overall difficulty level will be the same. The move follows the British government's efforts to learn from Shanghai's math teaching methods starting from last year. In the 2012 PISA, Shanghai students got first place on the math exam, while British students got 26th place. In September, the British government invited 60 of Shanghai's top math teachers to British schools to share their teaching experiences. A number of teachers from the UK also visited Shanghai for experience. \"It seems that the Shanghai teaching methodology uses resources much more effectively,\" said Liz Truss, a government education official. \"We have stagnated in our math performance for the last 15 years, and it's time for us to learn and put into good practices.\" (1) 题目内容: 在2012年的PISA数学考试中，哪个国家获得了第一名？选项: A. 美国 B. 中国 C. 日本 D. 英国 (2) 题目内容: 英国政府邀请中国数学教师到英国学校是为了__。选项: A. 分享教学经验 B. 学习新的教学方法 C. 改善教育环境 D. 教英国学生数学 (3) 题目内容: 最后一段中的带下划线的词<b><u>“stagnated”</u></b>是什么意思？选项: A. 开始推进 B. 预期获得 C. 停滞不前 D. 尝试学习 (4) 题目内容: 这篇文章主要讲什么？选项: A. 为什么英国使用中国的数学教材。 B. 如何提高英国孩子的数学技能。 C. 多练习能带来不同的效果。 D. 中国有最好的教学方法。", "ques_answer": ["B", "A", "C", "A"], "ques_analyze": "本篇阅读材料介绍了英国政府决定引进中国上海的数学教材与教学方法的背景与措施。通过细节分析可以回答以下问题：\n(1) 文中提到，在2012年PISA数学考试中，上海学生获得了第一名。\n(2) 英国政府邀请中国数学教师是为了分享他们的教学经验。\n(3) 根据上下文语境，'stagnated'指的是英国数学教学成绩在过去15年中停滞不前，未能提高。\n(4) 全文的主旨是关于英国政府通过引进中国的数学教材和教学方法来提升他们的数学教学质量。此题主要考察学生的细节理解、词义猜测和主旨归纳能力。需要从文中获取直接信息和通过上下文逻辑推断出答案。", "ques_knowledges": ["教育", "说明文", "细节理解", "主旨大意", "词句猜测"]}

Some Chinese parents are happy to see their children studying late, thinking that they are hardworking, but not all parents agree with this view. A mother once told us that every morning her 10-year-old son, with his eyes still closed, would put up one finger, begging for one more minute to sleep. Like thousands of \"early birds\" in China, he has to get up before six every morning. A report shows that students who do not get a good night's sleep seem to be weaker than they should be. Many students have experienced dozing off during class. Staying up late is not only due to too much homework; some students stay up late watching TV or playing computer games. Experts suggest that students should develop good study habits. Therefore, some clever students never study late and are able to perform well in class.\n\n1) The 10-year-old boy begged for one more minute to sleep because______. 选项: A. he didn’t have enough sleep B. it wasn’t time for him to get up C. he didn’t want to go to school D. he wanted his mother to wake him up\n\n2) From this passage, we know that if students don’t get enough sleep, they may______. 选项: A. become too weak to sleep B. not work well in class C. go to bed early D. be weak in English\n\n3) In this passage, \"early birds\" means \"persons who ______\". 选项: A. get up early B. get up late C. sleep less D. don’t want to sleep\n\n4) \"Staying up late\" here means \"______\". 选项: A. study late B. watch TV late C. not go to bed until late D. stay outside\n\n5) According to the passage, which of the following is right? 选项: A.

{"subject": "初中英语", "ques_type": "阅读单选", "ques_difficulty": "容易", "ques_content": "题目内容: Tea, the most typical English drink, became popular in Britain due to the influence of a foreign princess, Catherine of Braganza. She was the queen of Charles II and a lover of tea since her childhood in Portugal. She brought the habit of drinking tea to the English royal court and started a tea-drinking trend in the seventeenth century. This fashion quickly spread from the circle of the nobility to the middle classes. In London coffee houses, people often drank tea while conducting business and discussing events. Many employers provided a cup of tea to their workers during the mid-morning break, thus inventing a lasting British tradition—the \"tea break.\" However, drinking tea outside the workplace was a luxury beyond the reach of most British people, as it was expensive and taxed. Around 1800, the seventh Duchess of Bedford, Anne Maria, began the popular practice of \"afternoon tea,\" a ceremony taking place at about four o'clock. Until then, people did not usually eat or drink anything between lunch and dinner. At approximately the same time, the Earl of Sandwich popularized a new way of eating bread—placing jam or cucumbers between thin slices of bread. Before long, a small meal at the end of the afternoon, involving tea and sandwiches, had become part of the British way of life. As tea became much cheaper during the nineteenth century, its popularity spread throughout all corners of British society. Thus, tea became Britain's favorite drink. In working-class households, it was served with the main meal of the day, eaten when workers returned home after a day's labor. This meal has become known as \"high tea.\" Today, tea can be drunk at any time of the day and accounts for over two-fifths of all beverages consumed in Britain, second only to water.

The facial recognition technology can also be used for surveillance and commercial use. Great achievements have been made in facial recognition technology in recent years. The technology is used to identify a missing child. High-speed computers are now able to process all the data we need to process. Machines can now match faces even when the lighting isn't good or when a full shot of the face is not available.

Try to imagine that everyday items such as our house keys, our car keys, our ATM cards, our passwords are all starting to go away, and instead, we’re going to be using facial recognition.

See if you can get it: “I’m not a fan of the new pound coin, but then again, I hate all change.” It’s actually a pun (双关语) on the word “change” (零钱；改变). The UK started to use new coins this year. And that’s not the only change taking place in the country recently. Many British people don’t like some changes, such as the UK leaving the European Union. The coin joke is a classic British one - you would have to think about the joke to understand it. The British are known for<u> having a dry sense of humor.</u> It probably won’t be said with a laugh or a smile and will be said when you least expect it. Americans, on the other hand, enjoy straightforward (直白的) jokes. Many jokes are about cultural, racial (种族的) and gender (性别) differences. That’s because the US is a “melting pot” with people from different cultures. Telling jokes can help people to overcome their differences. Here is an example of American humor by comedian Chris Rock: “You know the world is going crazy when the best rapper (说唱歌手) is a white guy, the best golfer (高尔夫球运动员) is a black guy, the tallest guy in the NBA is Chinese.” Rock is referring to Eminem, Tiger Woods and Yao Ming.

One cold winter morning, Tapiwa Chiwewe was driving to work in Johannesburg, South Africa. He noticed a haze hanging over the city and soon realized it was a huge cloud of air pollution. At that moment, Chiwewe wanted to do something about it, but didn’t know how to start. He was a computer engineer and knew little about environmental science. First, he researched the issue of air pollution and found that it is one of the world’s biggest environmental health crises. He decided to address the problem in a cooperative way. He talked to scientists, officials, and engineers, which helped him gain a deeper understanding of the situation and come up with an idea for improvement. After years of effort, Chiwewe and his colleagues from South Africa and China created an online air quality decision support system. Based on historical and real-time data, the system can accurately predict air pollution and air quality, helping people make better daily decisions and assisting officials in better managing their work. Chiwewe learned a lesson—“a lesson we all need to take to heart if we are to work towards a better future. Even if you’re not an expert in a particular field, your outside expertise may hold the key to solving problems within that field,” he said. What if Chiwewe hadn’t bothered to research the problem and take action? What if he had just hoped that someone, somewhere, was taking care of the matter? As he said, “Why not just go ahead and deal with the problem as well as you can, in your own way? You may be pleasantly surprised.” (1) 题目内容: 是什么促使奇维韦采取行动？选项: A. 他不知道薄雾是什么。 B. 他注意到了城市上空的空气污染。 C. 他不想成为一名计算机工程师。 D. 他是一名环境科学专家。  (2) 题目内容: 奇维韦是按照怎样的顺序解决问题的？a. 征求专家建议 b. 创建在线系统 c. 研究问题 d. 允许他人使用系统 选项: A. cabd B. abcd C. cdab D. adbc  (3) 题目内容: 最后两段的要点是什么？选项: A. 我们应该总是与他人合作。B. 永远有新的东西可以学习。C. 专家在处理问题时需要进行研究。D. 采取行动比等待他人更好。", "ques_answer": ["B", "A", "D"], "ques_analyze": "奇维韦注意到城市上空的空气污染，这促使他采取了行动。首先，他对空气污染进行了研究，以了解其严重性，然后征求了专家的意见来深入理解情况和提出改进的想法。接着，他与同事合作创建了一个在线空气质量决策支持系统，该系统基于历史和实时数据，可以准确预测空气污染状况，从而帮助人们做出更好的日常决策，并帮助官员更有效地管理操作。奇维韦的故事强调了主动采取行动的重要性，而不是依赖他人。这一点体现了文章的核心思想—自主行动更胜于被动等待。", "ques_knowledges": ["叙述经历", "哲理感悟", "记叙文", "细节理解", "推理判断"]}

Studying is very important for students. However, it is always difficult to find enough time to study all the subjects you need. Therefore, a good study plan can help you ensure success in your studies. So, how to make a study plan? First, you can list all the subjects you need to study and identify the tasks you need to complete for each subject. Next, you should decide how much time to allocate to different subjects. It is a good idea to study at the same time every day, as this will make it easier for you to remember your plan. While arranging time for each subject, you also need to make sure you have time to spend with family, friends, and rest. This is because you will not be able to succeed if you cannot balance your personal life and your studies. Once the plan is made, the next thing you need to do is to follow it. One of the biggest challenges in following your plan is that you will be tempted to do something relaxing or fun instead of studying. Fortunately, you can resist this temptation by taking breaks. But make sure not to take extra breaks or breaks that are too long, as this can affect your plan. At the start of your break, you can set an alarm to remind you when your break is over. Use your break wisely, for example, by taking a short walk, having a snack, or listening to music. To avoid forgetting to follow your plan, try to check your schedule every day. Sometimes, our plans are hard to follow because important people in our lives distract us. To avoid this, tell people in your life about your plan.

Your mood will be very pleasant if you are ready to achieve goals or pursue something you value. Secondly, make yourself stay with happy people. It is easy to begin to think negatively when you stay with people who think this way. However, if you are around happy people, you will become happy too. Thirdly, when something goes wrong, try to find a solution instead of being lost in self-pity. Truly happy people don’t let difficulties affect their happiness because they know that with a little thought, they can improve the situation. Fourthly, spend a few minutes each day thinking about the things that make you happy. These minutes will help you focus on the positive things in your life. It’s also important to spend some time each day doing something nice for yourself. Whether you have lunch, take a relaxing bath, or simply spend a few minutes on your appearance, you will put yourself in a better mood. Fifthly, finding humor in situations can also lead to happiness. Finding a way to look down upon a situation can make you happy too. Lastly, keeping healthy is another way to achieve happiness. Being overweight or not eating healthy foods can have a negative effect on your mood. After all, having a healthy body is the capital of revolution. 根据文章内容，判断句子是对(T)还是错(F)。作答类型为T/F(对/错)。 1.

It took me 10 months to recover. During that time, I realized I needed to find a more meaningful purpose in life,\" said Julia. As soon as she recovered, Julia quit her job at the restaurant and traveled to California. One day, she discovered that a big company was planning to cut down a forest, which had many redwood trees, including one that was over 1,000 years old. Later, Julia learned that a group called Our Earth was trying to protect the redwood forest from the company. She volunteered to join the group. Julia lived in a redwood tree for over two years without ever coming down. During this time, she experienced cold and wet weather, and even severe winter storms.

Some people think bottled water is healthier than tap water, but that's not true. In the United States, the government ensures that tap water is safe. People love bottled water because it is convenient to carry. But if they understand the problems it causes, they might try drinking from a glass at home or carrying water in a reusable bottle instead of a plastic one. Although some plastic water bottles can be turned into other useful items, only a small number are recycled. The rest are taken away by garbage trucks, or worse, they end up as litter on land, in rivers, lakes, and the ocean. Plastic bottles take hundreds of years to break down. Water is good for you, so keep drinking it. But think about how often you use plastic water bottles, and see if you can make a change. If you take a plastic water bottle to school, don't throw it away — bring it home and refill it with tap water for the next day.作答类型为T/F(对/错) 1. 美国人的瓶装水消费量是世界第一。 2. 自来水安全由联合国确保。 3. 我们使用的塑料水瓶会导致严重污染。 4. 塑料水瓶需要一百年才能分解。 5. 在扔掉塑料水瓶之前尽量多次使用。", "ques_answer": ["T", "F", "T", "F", "T"], "ques_analyze": "本文讨论了瓶装水的消费情况以及它对环境的影响。1. 根据文章第一段，美国的瓶装水消费量超过世界任何国家，因此第一题答案为True。2. 第二段指出是美国政府确保自来水安全，而非联合国，所以第二题答案为False。3. 第三段描述了塑料瓶对土壤、河流、湖泊和海洋的污染以及其需要数百年才能分解，表明塑料瓶确实导致了严重污染，所以第三题答案为True。4. 同样根据第三段描述，塑料瓶的分解需要几百年而不是一百年，因此第四题答案为False。5. 最后一段建议如果带塑料水瓶去学校，不要抛弃，而是带回家重复使用，这反映了尽量多次使用塑料水瓶的建议，所以第五题答案为True。", "ques_knowledges": ["环保", "记叙文", "细节理解", "推理判断"]}

When he got there, he saw a lot of fruit for sale, but most of it was very expensive. Only a big basket of red fruit was cheap. “How much per kilo?” the old man asked. “Two rupees,” the shopkeeper answered. Two rupees in India is almost nothing. So the old man bought a kilogram and started eating them. However, as soon as he started eating, his mouth began to burn, his eyes began to water, and his whole face became as red as the fruit. As he coughed and struggled to breathe, he jumped up and down, screaming, “Ah! Ah! Ah!” And then he continued to eat the “fruit”! Some people saw him and said, “Those are chili peppers! You can’t just eat them by the handful!” The old man said, “I paid for them, so I must eat them.” This old man must seem pretty stupid. But are we a lot smarter? In our life, all of us have put money, time, and effort into something—maybe a relationship or a job—and sometimes, even if we know there’s no hope that things will get better, we still continue with it. Why? Because we’ve put in all that money, time, and effort. What we can learn from the old man is this: if you’ve lost a lot for something that doesn’t work, let it go and move on.

She helps her mom cook. On weekends, she helps wash clothes. \"I was able to cook when I was eight. My father said sometimes I cooked better than mom!\" Zhou said she wanted to be a doctor when she grew up. \"I watched TV and found that there were many people with AIDS in Henan. Some are kids.

According to a recent survey by China Youth Daily, more than 76 percent of young people in China said they felt their Chinese language skills have weakened. They don’t use difficult rhetorical techniques as often anymore. Digital technology and Internet emojis are believed to have changed communicating habits. For example, \"copy and paste\" culture is getting popular. People simply pick up expressions from the Internet without much thought. Many begin to use a fixed set of sentence patterns, such as \"Whenever you disagreed with each other, you…” Cai Xiaojia, a teacher from Zhuzhou, told China Youth Daily that words in general are being used less. For example, people can share photos online with little need for words to describe them. If this trend continues, it could influence our way of thinking, People's Daily noted. When we use expressions without thinking, it means we have become too lazy to express our real feelings. If teenagers continue to use direct expressions and emojis, they could lose the ability to use words properly.

{"subject": "初中英语", "ques_type": "阅读判断", "ques_difficulty": "一般", "ques_content": "题目内容: In the eyes of many foreigners, Chinese are the best hosts and the worst guests in the world. And western hosts sometimes look impolite in the eyes of Chinese guests. It’s because the guest-host relationship in China is quite different from that in some western countries. In China, guests are almost like gods. Whenever I enter a Chinese friend’s home, there is always fruit on the table for me, and someone is quick to bring me a cup of tea or water. In the west, generally the guest is not a god. Acting according to the host’s way of doing things is usual behavior for a guest. My wife’s mother, a very kind Chinese lady, doesn’t smoke. When I see her guests smoking in her house, as a non-smoker, I feel unhappy. Usually, I want to stop them directly, but I must realize that in China, to be a good host, she must not do that. In most North American homes, if you are a guest, and the hosts are not smokers, you should ask, “Is it OK if I smoke?” But don’t be surprised if they say, “No.” In my culture, if you smoke in their house, you are a bad guest, but if they don't allow you to smoke in their house, they are not impolite hosts. Guests in China also have special habits. They usually give hosts gifts when visiting a Chinese family. However, it’s not necessary in my country. So if you invite foreign guests to your home, don’t be too surprised if they don’t bring you a gift. In a word, no matter where you are, the best way to be a good guest is to adapt to the habits of your hosts.\n\n判断题，T代表正确，F代表错误：\n1. When a western guest visits a Chinese family, he is often regarded as a god.\n2. The writer’s wife’s mother will stop her guests smoking because she isn’t a smoker.\n3.
